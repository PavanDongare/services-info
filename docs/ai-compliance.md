## Risk Classification System

### Four-Tier Framework

| Risk Level | Requirement | Examples |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Unacceptable** | Prohibited entirely | Social scoring systems, manipulative AI, real-time biometric identification (with exceptions) |
| **High-Risk** | Heavy regulation, human oversight required | Employment decisions, credit scoring, educational assessments |
| **Limited** | Transparency obligations | Chatbots, emotion recognition systems |
| **Minimal** | Largely unregulated | AI-enabled video games, spam filters |

---

## High-Risk Classification Triggers

### Automated Personal Data Processing
AI systems that profile individuals through automated processing of personal data to evaluate:
- **Work performance**: Employee productivity monitoring, performance assessments
- **Economic situation**: Credit scoring, loan eligibility
- **Health**: Medical diagnosis support, health risk assessments
- **Behavior**: Behavioral prediction, pattern analysis
- **Location**: Movement tracking, geographic profiling

### Sector-Specific High-Risk Applications
- Critical infrastructure management
- Education and vocational training
- Employment and worker management
- Access to essential services (public and private)
- Law enforcement applications
- Migration and asylum management
- Administration of justice

## Compliance Requirements

### Documentation & Logging (Articles 12, 19)
- **Automatic logging** of AI system activities
- Retain logs for appropriate audit periods
- Enable traceability of AI decisions
- Document training data and model versions

### Human Oversight (Article 14)
- **Mandatory human oversight** for high-risk AI systems
- **Two-person verification** for critical decisions
- Clear escalation procedures
- Override capabilities for human operators

### Right to Explanation (Article 86)
- Individuals have the right to explanation for AI-driven decisions
- Must provide clear, meaningful information about:
  - The role of AI in the decision
  - Main parameters and logic involved
  - Data used in the decision

## Penalties & Enforcement

### Violation Categories

| Violation Type | Maximum Penalty |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Prohibited practices | **€40M** or **7%** of global annual turnover |
| Data governance violations | **€20M** or **4%** of global annual turnover |
| Other non-compliance | **€10M** or **2%** of global annual turnover |

*For SMEs and startups, the lower of the two amounts applies.*
